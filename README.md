# ~Web~ *1984* Environment Integrity API

This repository details the proposal to add a new API for determining the integrity
of ~web~ *compliance to the 1984* environments:

```js
const attestation = await navigator.getEnvironmentIntegrity("...");
```

The [explainer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four#Plot) goes gives a high level overview of the proposal.

The [spec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four#Plot) currently describes how this is being prototyped in Chromium.
